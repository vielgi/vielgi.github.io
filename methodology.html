                        This project’s main objective is to separate facts from fiction when it comes to actual Presidential records by looking directly at the data,
                        starting from Truman in 1947 and ending with Obama in 2014. To that end we looked at the changes from the beginning of the two-year terms to
                        the end of same term, for a variety of  Economic Indicators including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Median Income Change
                            GDP Change
                            Consumer Price Index Change
                            S&P500 Change
                            Budget as of GDP
                            Budget As Percentage Change
                            Debt
                            Unemployment Change
                            Unemployment (As Percentage of Workforce)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The Two-Year Term was chosen because US Congress is on such an election cycle and the President works with legislature in order to pass 
                        laws that may have potential bearing on the economy. Our coordinated map view captures that -- sometime Presidents work with opposition 
                        (say Eisenhower) and sometime they don’t (e.g. Truman) -- the assumption being, that it may be easier for the President that pass their
                        economic agenda with a supporting Congress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Change is more useful for comparison than nominal data  -- meaning that if Median Income was down in the 1947 Truman’s term by 5% that 
                        can be directly compared to Nixon’s 1973 term of 5% decline! And, again, we’re looking and comparing only two-year terms! And even the 
                        notable exceptions of Kennedy and Nixon who didn’t complete their entire terms should not interfere too much with this line of reasoning 
                        as they were succeeded by presidents of the same party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, our project is intended for a visitor’s self-exploration and that’s why we chose not to include commentary and conclusions from the data
                          -- we trust the user to be able to draw their own conclusions by observing the data visualizations. And, of course, there are a myriad other
                         factors contributing to a President’s term in office on the economy and everything else -- we deliberately don’t claim any correlation or 
                        causality between the two. This is what, after all politicians would like us to believe or at least when the data is in their favor and vehemently
                         oppose it when it’s not!
